# 5E Custom Currency module for Foundry VTT

Adjust currency name and conversion rates for 5th Edition D&D

## Installation

1. Open Foundry's Setup screen
2. Switch to the "Add-On Modules" tab
3. Click "Install Module"
4. Paste `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ktrieun/FVTT-5e-custom-currency/master/module.json` into the "Manifest URL" field
5. Click "Install"

## Notes

* On saving the settings, reopen any character sheets in order to update settings.

### Changing Currency Names on Character Sheet
* This is mostly superficial as many systems depend on the current currency paradigm, but on your character sheets, it will reference your custom names rather than the D&D 5E standards.

## Compatibility

Currently supports any dnd5e character sheet that uses the default currency names and exchange rates from the DND5E config.js file.

### Confirmed Compatible
* Default 5e Character Sheet
* Tidy5e Sheet
* DNDBeyond Character Sheet for 5e

### Not Compatible

* D&D 5e OGL Character Sheet
* Compact DnDBeyond 5e Character Sheet
* Lazy Money (if using Independent Currencies)
* Pick-Up-Stix
